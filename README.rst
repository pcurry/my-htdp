What is this?
-------------

This is my set of answers and partial work for the exercises in How To Design Programs.  I'm working on this for a couple of reasons.


Why?
----

1. I told a friend of mine I'd do it, years ago, and I haven't let go of that yet.
2. I want to help my girlfriend learn basic programming, and I believe HTDP is a good path to that.  So, I need to have finished the coursework if I'm to help her through the course.
3. I want an excuse to work in Scheme (well, Racket) more.
